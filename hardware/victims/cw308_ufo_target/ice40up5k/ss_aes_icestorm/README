Initial version for iCE40 UltraPlus breakout board.

Building the FPGA bitfile requires the Icestorm toolchain. Installation
instructions are here: http://bygone.clairexen.net/icestorm/

It should also be possible to build with Apio (https://github.com/FPGAwars/apio) which you may find easier to install.

Connect the following Header B pins to ChipWhisperer:
- 45A_G1 to HS2
- 42B to IO2
- 43A to IO1
- 38B to IO4
- ground

Keep all SW2 switches low.
- set 37A switch high to use 8 MHz on-board clock instead of CW clock
- set 36B to get a "clock alive" blue LED flash
