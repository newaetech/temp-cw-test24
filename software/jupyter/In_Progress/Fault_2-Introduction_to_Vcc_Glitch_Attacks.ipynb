If you're interested in doing more Vcc glitching, you may want to try [Tutorial A9](https://wiki.newae.com/Tutorial_A9_Bypassing_LPC1114_Read_Protect) from the ChipWhisperer Wiki, which uses Vcc glitching to bypass code readout protection on an LPC1114 (requires an LPC1114 dev board). You may also want to try glitching some of the other functions in `glitchsimple.c`. If you have a Raspberry Pi, you can also attempt the attack described [here](https://wiki.newae.com/Tutorial_A3_VCC_Glitch_Attacks#Glitching_More_Advanced_Targets:_Raspberry_Pi) (though you'll need to transfer the steps from the old GUI over to Jupyter)."
