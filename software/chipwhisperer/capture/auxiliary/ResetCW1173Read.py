    """Reset an AVR/XMEGA via the PDI/ISP interface.
    
    This class must be initialized with 2 values:
    - XMEGA/AVR: True if reseting XMEGA; False for AVR
    - Delay: How long to wait between device reset and scope arm
    
    Then, there are three self-explanatory functions that can be registered:
    - reset(): no delay. Useful for testing
    - resetThenDelay(): Useful for before_arm
    - delayThenReset(): Useful for after_arm
    
    Note that resetThenDelay() before arming is more consistent (resetting the 
    device can accidentally cause a trigger event) but delayThenReset() after 
    arming allows for a shorter delay between the reset and the scope
    measurement.
