PicoScope (USB Scope)
========================

The PicoScope is a USB-connected oscilloscope made by `PicoTech <www.http://picotech.com/>`__.
There is a wide range of scopes available to fit your budget, from $160 passport sized scopes
up to 5 GS/s or faster devices.

Using the PicoScope means the ChipWhisperer capture hardware is not required. Note it's
possible to use a combination of ChipWhisperer capture for tasks such as triggering, and
the PicoScope to perform the analog measurement.
