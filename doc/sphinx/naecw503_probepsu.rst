CW503 Probe Power Supply
========================

The CW503 provides a handy power supply for both the differential probe and the LNA. Multiple probes can be connected to a single power supply.

The power supply uses a micro-USB jack, allowing you to power the probe from front-pane USB ports on some instruments (be careful of current limits
if using this method).

Alternatively the probe comes with a high-quality 5.0V wall-wart adapter.
