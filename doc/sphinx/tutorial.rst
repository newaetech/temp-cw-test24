Tutorial: Breaking AES (Straightforward)
=========================================

This tutorial will take you through a complete attack on a software AES implementation.
The specific implementation being attacked is a well-known AES implementation written
in C, which is likely to be similar to other implementations used by proprietary systems.

Setting up the Hardware
------------------------

This tutorial uses the :ref:`hwcapturerev2` hardware along with the :ref:`hwmultitarget`
board. Note that you **don't need hardware** to complete the tutorial. Instead you can
download `example traces from the ChipWhisperer Assembla <https://www.assembla.com/spaces/chipwhisperer/wiki/Example_Captures>`__.

This example uses the Atmel AVR in 28-pin DIP programmed with 

Setting up the Software
------------------------

It is assumed that you've already followed the guide in :ref:`installing`. Thus you are able to communicate with the
